## A Quest for honor


</div>

### Description

This is updated now..It will compile.

This is a game I made for a school project. Its not all that great, but I think it give some beginners a few pointers. Its not well commented, so you can e-mail me questions and I will respond and try to explain.

Thanks much to Andres Zacarias for his code on maps, main form graphics, and bitblt. His program is something like Quest.

My graphics are pretty crappy, but they are effective.
 
### More Info
